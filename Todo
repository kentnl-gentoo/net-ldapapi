LDAPv2 API Support:
- Add ldap_url Functions
- Add ldap_filter Functions

LDAPv3 API Support:
- Need an API and a Server First, but definately intend to do.

Perl Things:
- While strictly following the LDAP C API works well for people
  who are already familiar with the C API, PERL lovers will
  obviously be interested in having some of this available with
  a more Perl5'ish OO interface.

- Thus, I've begun an additional group of functions within the
  LDAPapi.pm file that allow the end-programmer to take a slightly
  more "Perl5" approach to LDAP programming.  This includes using
  blessed objects rather than the hidden LDAP structures, among
  other things.

Examples:
- I've already completed most of a new WEB example.  It completely
  replaces web500gw and looks similar to WebPH.  V1.40 should include
  a finished 100% v1.0 of this gateway.  V1.36 contains a version with
  everything except the HELP and ADD functions.
  
- I plan to change all examples to work with -w and use Strict
  as I find time.
